=begin

I tried following the instructions, but it was easier to get to the 
classes page and use the command + f function to find the word
string and click it. https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/String.html
I will get the more current version of Ruby if it becomes an issue
but I had to delete my entire environment last time I tried
figuring that out with homebrew on AWS so for now it's 3.0.2
which is still acceptable per the Intro to Ruby book.
