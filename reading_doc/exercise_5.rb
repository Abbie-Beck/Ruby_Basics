=begin

  you can write integers using an underscore as a comma would be used
  1,234 becomes 1_234 and this allows for readability
  
  for floats, it gets more complex
  12.34 can be written as 1234e-2 
  (i assume the 2 references the number of characters from left to 
  right before the decimal)
  or 1.234E1
  (again, perhaps the 1 references how many characters exist from 
  left ro right before the decimal)
  
  and yes you can put the underscores wherever you want,
  returns the same value
